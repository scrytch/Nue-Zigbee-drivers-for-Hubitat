# Nue-Zigbee
Nue Zigbee single, 2 gang (double) and 3 gang (triple), Australia
Download and Install to Hubitat as driver code
Pair device to HE by following the instructions provided. 
Assign the newly created device to the appropriate code.
You may need to check that the endpoints for the double/triples have not changed. The newer units have different endpoints, and this needs to be changed in the drivers. 
Then use Virtual Device Sync from Erocm123 to map the 2/3 switches to human usable names, to use with Google Home etc. This is not required for the single light switch. 

Updated: Nue Zigbee Single, Double and Triple Gang Wall Switch Drivers Modified to allow Endpoint to be set by preference setting
